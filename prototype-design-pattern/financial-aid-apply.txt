I'm an engineering student in Turkey. I'm studying in a university away from my home. I have no income or scholarship only my parents support me. I rented a room, so in addition to food expenses also I have expenses related to my room such as invoices, house rent etc. It's nearly impossible to me spare some money for additional education. Even so our money values nothing compared to dollars because my country's economical situation is bad now and our money decreases too much in value compared to dollars. I need this certificate to show people I deserve a job and spent effort for learning important things and Probability and Statistics one of the vital skills for me. I'm a lifelong learner. If I have enough money to enroll this course I wouldn't hesitate for a moment. If I couldn't take opportunities how can I improve my economical situation and then enroll another courses? Actually it's my second application and I'm waiting for your good news. Thank you for your understanding.
